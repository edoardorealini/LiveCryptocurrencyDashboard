Consumer notes:

The main idea is to:
    - Retrieve the hystory data from cassandra once
    - put it into a dataframe
    - preprocess the df in order to make it usable from prophet
    - get the latest update from kafka for the specific crypto
    - retrain the prophet
    - generate the predictions for the next 7 days
    - put the updated predictions into cassandra 
        this should happen by appending 7 rows for the following 7 days and then 
        updating them every time the model makes a prediction

    - into cassandra we should store also the fields that are needed to plot correctly
        the data with the model's uncertanty and everything!

    - The fields that we need from the predictions that are generated are:
        - yhat: the actual predicted value
        - yhat_lower: the min predicted value (uncertainty)
        - yhat_higher: the max predicted value (uncertainty)
