Consumer notes:

The main idea is to:
    - Retrieve the hystory data from cassandra once
    - put it into a dataframe
    - preprocess the df in order to make it usable from prophet
    - get the latest update from kafka for the specific crypto
        - check if the data on cassandra is updated, otherwise update it (funzione rick)
    - retrain the prophet
    - generate the predictions for the next 7 days
    - (TODO) put the updated predictions into cassandra  
        this should happen by appending 7 rows for the following 7 days and then 
        updating them every time the model makes a prediction

    - (TODO) into cassandra we should store also the fields that are needed to plot correctly
        the data with the model's uncertanty and everything! (it can be stored flatly in the future field)

    - The fields that we need from the predictions that are generated are:
        - yhat: the actual predicted value
        - yhat_lower: the min predicted value (uncertainty)
        - yhat_higher: the max predicted value (uncertainty) 


Everything should happen symoultaneously for all the 10 cryptos.

I can manage to do this by throwing 10 threads that work in parallel and all do the same thing
